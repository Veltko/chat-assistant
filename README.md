# Objective
The goal of this project is to create an AI Chatbot Assistant by employing simple HTML and JavaScript with seamless integration of OpenAI into your website.

# Assistance of ChatGPT
I have developed and integrated the widget with the assistance of ChatGPT, customizing it to meet my specific requirements. 
You can make adjustments as needed to suit your preferences.

# Steps to Create the AI Chat Assistance
 1. Download the project from the GitHub repository.
 2. Obtain a paid OpenAI account and configure the Secret Keys to access the API.
 Note: Ensure that you do not disclose your secret keys publicly.
 3. Replace the Secret Keys with the parameter "OPENAI_API_KEY" in the chat-widget.js file.
 4. Remove the line "reply("Need a paid account of OpenAI")" as it is only included for demonstration purposes.

# Customization
  - You have the freedom to customize the code according to your specific requirements. For instance, after setting up the project, you may want to change the project name from "doiteasy" to something else.
  - The `onUserRequest` method is responsible for handling user requests, and the `reply` method provides the response in the chatbox.
